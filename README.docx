Key words
Juvenile delinquency, Crime spatial distribution, ArcGIS, hot-spot analysis, Spatial partial least squares regression
Introduction
In the United States, thousands of youths are arrested, convicted, and released annually. Young people who commit a crime in the U.S. risk entering the largest prison system in the world. Almost 1.5 million people were imprisoned in the U.S. at the end of 2018, according to data released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in 2020. Between 1978 and 2018, the U.S. prison population jumped by more than 375%. (2020, Bachelor’ s Sociology). 
According to the Juvenile Court Statistics report, the main categories of juvenile delinquency include simple assault, drug, Larceny, Obstruction of justice and Disorderly conduct. (Database of National Center for Juvenile Justice ,2020). Assault which accounted for around 20% of cases, involves the illegal intentional infliction without a deadly or dangerous weapon. Drug law violations, which accounted for 14% of cases, include the illegal purchase, sale, distribution, cultivation, manufacture, possession, transportation. Larceny, which accounted for 13% of cases, includes the unlawful taking of property or attempted taking of property from someone’s possession in stealth. Obstruction of justice, which accounted for 12% of the cases includes intentional obstruction of court or law enforcement efforts in administering justice, failing to obey a lawful court order, escaping from confinement, or violating parole or probation. 
Explanations of juvenile delinquency require consideration of two sets of elements. These are, on the one hand, the driving forces, the reasons, or motives behind the act and, on the other, the obstacles that stand in its way, the restraints that inhibit its occurrence. (Travis Hirschi, 2011). Furthermore, one generation of delinquent youths encourages the next to adopt delinquent values. The next generation then introduces delinquency to the subsequent generation, creating a vicious cycle. (Shaw and McKay, 2019). Family issues such as inconsistent or lax supervision and various forms of abuse are some of the most studied links to juvenile delinquency (U.S. Department of Justice,2010). Moreover, special distribution is another important factor to study the causes of juvenile delinquency. Individual behavior is influenced by spatial awareness that emerges from routine travel to activity nodes such as work, school, shopping, and recreation sites (Brantingham 2008).
This paper using a geography information system-based visualization crime analysis tool Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) which is built-in ArcGIS. The technique of Hotspot Mapping is widely used in analyzing the spatial characteristics of crimes. The spatial distribution of crime is related to a variety of socio-economic and crime opportunity factors. The proposed study method uses visualization techniques to show the distribution of juvenile delinquency and uses special partial least squares regression to calculate the correlation coefficient that helps us to analyze the correlation of the crime rate and factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency. Future studies will focus on predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of juvenile crimes using machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
